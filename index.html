So, my darling, I hope that this birthday and every birthday you have after, you are blessed with the best all goodness of the world because it would be lucky to come in contact with you. You already innately emit endless amounts marvellousness. I am so lucky to be your friend and I cannot believe you have allowed me the honour of being your lover but I am so glad you have. You are amazing, my honey. And you get more and more so every year. I can't wait to grow old with you!</i></p>
